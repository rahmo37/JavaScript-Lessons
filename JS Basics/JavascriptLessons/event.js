// An HTML event can be something the browser does or something a user does
// Event examples can be
// An HTML web page has finished loading 
// An HTML input field was changed
// An HTML button was clicked

// Why event is important?
// Because when an event occurs you might want to do somthing.
// Now JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

// HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements example, <element event='some JS code '>

// building this function so that it can be called from the HTML page
function displayAlert() {
 alert("test");
}

// what other common events can occure ?

 onchange = an HTML element has been changed
 onmouseover = user moves the mouse over an HTML element
 onmouseout = user moves the mouse out from the HTML element
 onkeydown user pushes a keyborad key
