./dom_CSS.js: This is like saying, "From where I am standing right now inside the building (current directory), find the dom_CSS.js right next to me."

../dom_CSS.js: This is like saying, "From where I am standing right now inside the building, go back one room and then find the dom_CSS.js in there."
