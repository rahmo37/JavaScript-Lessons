      // first way to get an output is to use the getElementByID and changing its innerHTML
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;

      //second way is to write in the document directly
      // However document.write should only be used for testing
      document.write(5 + 16, " Writing in the document directly");

      // third way is to use the alert attribute of the window object
      // since window in the global object, you can skip window and just write alert
      window.alert(5 + 6);
      // since window in the global object, you can skip window and just write alert
      alert("press ok");

      // another way is to use console.log
      // this is only used for back end user
      // it wont show the output in the body of the browser
      console.log("Hello World");
