Another fascinating fact about the Milky Way galaxy is its collision course with the Andromeda galaxy. Astronomical observations and calculations indicate that the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, which are both part of the Local Group of galaxies, are on a path to collide and merge in about 4 billion years. This event, often referred to as "Milkomeda," will be a monumental cosmic occurrence, reshaping the structure of both galaxies. Despite the colossal scale of this collision, due to the vast distances between stars within each galaxy, it is unlikely that individual stars will collide. The eventual merger will lead to the formation of a new type of galaxy, possibly an elliptical one.
