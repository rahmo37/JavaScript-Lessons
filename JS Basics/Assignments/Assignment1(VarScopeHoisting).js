// *Assignment1:
// ?related to JS Foundation folder, variables.js

// !Create a Script Using Different Variable Declarations:

// Write a JavaScript script that includes:
// At least two variables declared with each let, var, and const.
// Demonstrate the difference in scope by declaring variables inside and outside of a block.
// Show an example of hoisting with var and explain why it doesn't work the same way with let.
// Create a const object and modify one of its properties.
// Explain Your Code:

// !After writing the script, add comments to explain:
// How each variable is scoped.
// The impact of hoisting on var declared variables.
// Why you can modify the property of a const object but not reassign the object itself.

// !Reflection:
// Reflect on the implications of using let, var, and const in different scenarios. Consider how these declarations affect code readability, maintainability, and potential bugs.
