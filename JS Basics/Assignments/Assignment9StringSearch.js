//! Part 1: indexOf() and lastIndexOf()

// Create a string variable with the text of your choice. Use the indexOf() method to find the first occurrence of a word or character in your string. Print the index to the console.
// Use the lastIndexOf() method to find the last occurrence of the same word or character. Compare the results and explain the difference.

//! Part 2: search()

// Use the search() method to find a word in your string. Note the index of the first occurrence.
// Try to use search() with a regular expression. For example, search for a word regardless of case sensitivity.

//! Part 3: match() and matchAll()

// Use the match() method to find all occurrences of a pattern in your string. Use both a simple string and a regular expression as arguments.
// Explore matchAll() with a regular expression that includes the global flag. Iterate over the results and print them.

//! Part 4: includes(), startsWith(), and endsWith()

// Check if your string includes a specific word or phrase using includes(). Try this with and without a starting index.
// Use startsWith() to check if your string begins with a certain character or word.
// Use endsWith() to verify if your string ends with a specific term.

// !Comprehensive Assignment: Combine Your Knowledge
// Create a mini-program that utilizes all the methods learned (indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), search(), match(), matchAll(), includes(), startsWith(), endsWith()). The program should analyze a long text (you can choose a paragraph or two from a book or article). Your program should:

// Find the occurrences of three different words or patterns, using different methods for each.
// Check if the text includes a specific phrase, starts with a certain word, and ends with a certain word.
// Print a summary of your findings, including the indexes of occurrences, whether certain patterns are found, and if the text meets the startsWith and endsWith conditions.
// Guidelines for Critical Thinking:

// Why might you choose one method over another for specific tasks?
// How can regular expressions enhance your search capabilities?
// Consider the efficiency and readability of your code. How might these methods affect the performance of your script in a larger project?
