// *Assignment7:
// ?related to JS Foundation folder, string.js and w3schools Strings


// !Assignment 1: Exploring String Creation and Quotes
// Objective: Practice creating strings using both single and double quotes and understand how to include quotes within a string.

// Task: Create two variables, one using single quotes and the other using double quotes. Both should contain the sentence: Learning JavaScript is fun!
// Task: Create a string that includes both single and double quotes within it, such as: She said, "It's a beautiful day!" Demonstrate two ways to achieve this.



// !Assignment 2: Using Escape Characters
// Objective: Understand and apply escape characters in strings to include special characters.

// Task: Create a string variable that includes a double quote inside it. For example, the output should be: The "escape" character is useful.
// Task: Create a string that includes a new line and a tab. Use it to format the following sentence across two lines: JavaScript is powerful.\tIt allows for complex web applications.



// !Assignment 3: Template Strings and Multiline Text
// Objective: Explore the use of template strings for including variables and creating multiline strings.

// Task: Create a template string that uses both single and double quotes inside it without needing escape characters. Example sentence: Template strings can include "double" and 'single' quotes easily.
// Task: Use a template string to create a multiline string that represents a simple address, including street, city, and zip code on separate lines.



// !Assignment 4: String Length and Access
// Objective: Learn to find the length of a string and access specific characters within it.

// Task: Create a string and find its length. Print both the string and its length to the console.
// Task: Access the first, middle, and last character of a string. If the string is JavaScript, print J, S, and t.


// !Assignment 5: Strings as Objects vs. Primitive Strings
// Objective: Understand the difference between strings created as primitive values and those created as objects.

// Task: Create a primitive string and a string object with the same value. Compare them using == and === to observe the difference. Explain the results in comments.
// Task: Compare two string objects containing the same value using == and ===. Then, compare their values using the valueOf() method. Explain the outcomes.




// !Comprehensive Assignment: Manipulating and Comparing Strings
// Objective: Combine all the lessons learned about strings into a single, comprehensive task.

// Task: Write a script that does the following:

// Prompt the user for their full name.
// Check if the name includes any quotation marks (single or double) and remove them.
// Split the name into first and last name assuming a single space separates them. Consider edge cases where there might be multiple spaces or none.
// Convert the first and last names to template strings that spell out each character on a new line.
// Compare the length of the first and last names using primitive values and as objects. Discuss the comparison in comments within your code.
// Finally, output a formatted address using a template string, including the sanitized name, a made-up street, city, and zip code, all on separate lines.
